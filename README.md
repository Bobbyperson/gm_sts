# gm_sts
gm_sts is a gamemode built in Garry's mod originally by Tergative. It is inspired by the Sven Co-op map bm_sts by Trempler. The gameplay consists of randomizing and upgrading units as a team and fighting against other team's units. Every two rounds a bonus round occurs which awards teams points based on objectives completed.
